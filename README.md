# hangman
## Description
Hangman game played in the command line. The program selects a word from a word list randomly, and you have a set number of chances to guess it.

## Installation
Python has to be installed on the computer. Then, all you have to do is run ```main.py``` to launch the script.

Command : ```python main.py```

## Usage
Once the script is launched, the user will be asked to input a letter. If the user inputs anything other than a letter (a digit, a special character, a space), it will be considered an error. Every time your guess is wrong, you lose a life. Once you are out of lives or you find the word, the game ends.
